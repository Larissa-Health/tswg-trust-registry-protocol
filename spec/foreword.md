### Introduction

*This section is non-normative*

A [[ref: trust registry]] is a resource that helps to bind governance (business, legal, and social mandates) for an ecosystem. A trust registry helps get the main answers that parties inside and outside of the ecosystem need to tie the governance into their own systems - both technically (it is a protocol) and on a governance (the information provided is created via a governed process).

It is crucially important to understand that a trust registry does not create trust, nor the conditions for trust, by itself. Trust and belief in the data provided by a trust registry is an outcome of governance. 

We need answers to a simple question:

> Does `Entity X` have `Authorization Y`, in the context of `Ecosystem Governance Framework Z`?
